# TODO

## Examples

* Something TCP related like the Time protocol

* Iterate on `BigExample1.hs` until the spcification
  is sufficiently complex, things to add:
    * Buying things that are not books,
      different product categories maybe?
    * Removing an item from the shopping bag,
      maybe need to create a more rich language
      to describe that you can't choose "remove"
      if the bag is empty

* Something interesting where we can test duality
