# TODO

## Examples

* Iterate on `BigExample1.hs` until the spcification
  is sufficiently complex, things to add:
    * Buying things that are not books,
      different product categories maybe?

* Something interesting where we can test duality
  * The Game example from the slides!

* Another `BigExample` which is more stateful

* Being mindful of sized generators! (and priority inversion...)
