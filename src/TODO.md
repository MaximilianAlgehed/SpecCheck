# TODO

## Examples

* Something TCP related like the Time protocol

* Iterate on `BigExample1.hs` until the spcification
  is sufficiently complex, things to add:
    * Buying things that are not books,
      different product categories maybe?

* Something interesting where we can test duality

* Another `BigExample` which is more stateful
